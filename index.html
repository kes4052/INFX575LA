                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Myanmar’s democratic election in November 2015--its first after emerging from nearly 50 years of military dictatorship--is a novel area of research that has yet to be explored with data science methodologies. Close examination of digitized data on the 2015 election results and candidates can shed light on political, electoral, and information issues, and further can provide a new, unique lens through which to examine the democratic process in Myanmar. The 2015 election, and the information issues that complicated it, represent a novel area of research that has yet to be explored with data science methodologies. In coordination with the University of Washington Information School’s Technology and Social CHAnge (TASCHA) group and the Enlightened Myanmar Research Foundation (EMReF) in Yangon, Myanmar, we are among the first group of analysts to have access to data about this historic election. </p>
                <p>We draw on two sets of data provided by EMReF: election results data, and candidate demographic data. Despite missing data, these datasets include salient information regarding candidate ethnicity, geographic factors, and political parties.</p>
